# Voice Builder

Voice Builder is an opensource text-to-speech (TTS) voice building tool that
focuses on simplicity, flexibility, and collaboration. Our
tool allows anyone with basic computer skills to run voice training experiments
and listen to the resulting synthesized voice.

We hope that this tool will reduce the barrier for creating new voices and
accelerate TTS research, by making experimentation faster and
interdisciplinary collaboration easier. We believe that our tool can help
improve TTS research, especially for low-resourced languages,
where more experimentations are often needed to get the most out of the limited
data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Create a project on [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com).

    > If you don't have an account yet, please create one for yourself.

2. Enable billing and request more quota for your project

3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

4. Go to [firebase.com](https://firebase.com) and import the project to firebase platform

    > If you don't have an account yet, please create one for yourself.

5. Install gcloud cmd line tool by installing [Cloud
   SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads)

6. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

7. Install [firebase cmd line tool](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools)

8. Enable all the following GCP services:
    - Appengine API
    - Firebase Cloud Function
    - Genomics Pipeline API

    Use [this url](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=genomics,storage_component,storage_api,compute_component,containerregistry.googleapis.com) to enable them all at once.

    Usually, it would take a few minutes to enable APIs and
		GCP will bring you to another page to set credentials for these.
    Please just skip and close the page as we don't need any new credential setting.

9. [Optional] Setup your own [custom data exporter](https://github.com/google/voice-builder#optional-using-custom-data-exporter)

### Deployment

> If you have not completed all prerequisites, please do so before going further in the following steps.

1. Clone this project to your current directory by:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/google/voice-builder.git && cd voice-builder
    ```

2. If you haven't logged in to your account via gcloud yet, please log in by:

    ```
    gcloud auth login
    ```

3. Also, if you haven't logged in to your account via firebase, please log in by:

    ```
    firebase login --no-localhost
    ```

3. Open `deploy.sh` and edit the following variables:

    - PROJECT_NAME: your created GCP project's name from Prerequisite 1) e.g. vb-test-project
    - PROJECT_ID: your created GCP project's id from Prerequisite 1) e.g. vb-test-project
    - GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL: Use Compute Engine service account (you can find
    one by clicking on top left menu under "IAM & admin > Service accounts") e.g.
    123456778911-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com

4. Create GCS buckets for Voice Builder to store each job data

    ```
    ./deploy.sh initial_setup
    ```

5. Deploy cloud functions component

    ```
    ./deploy.sh cloud_functions
    ```

4. Deploy ui component

    ### Docker version > 18.03

    Before running ui deployment please run

    ```
    gcloud auth configure-docker
    ```

    to configure `docker` to use `gcloud` as a credential helper

    ### Docker version <=  18.03

    If you are running the deprecated versioning of Docker (`18.03` or lower),
    edit

    `build_docker.sh`

    Uncommenting line 37

    ```
    gcloud docker --project="${PROJECT_ID}" -- push "$IMAGE"
    ```

    and commenting out line 45

    ```
    #docker -- push gcr.io/blackfoot-revitalization/ui:latest
    ```

    to edit the code to run the Docker push directly through `gcloud`

    Now run:

    ```
    ./deploy.sh ui create
    ```
    After the deployment, you should get an IP that you can access from command
    line's result (EXTERNAL_IP). You can access your instance of Voice Builder
    by visiting http://EXTERNAL_IP:3389 in
    your browser.

### Create an example voice
At this step, you should have all components in place and can access the UI
  at http://EXTERNAL_IP:3389. VoiceBuilder initially provides you with two
  example TTS engines ([Festival](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/)
  and [Merlin](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/merlin/)) and public data
  from [language resources repo](https://github.com/googlei18n/language-resources).

  You can test if everything is now working correctly by creating a new voice
  yourself using our provided Festival engine by:
  1. Access http://EXTERNAL_IP:3389 and go to a create-voice form by clicking
    "CREATE VOICE" tab on top.
  2. You will see a form where you can choose different TTS engines and input
    data for your voice. Just skim through as we will use this initial config
    for building a new voice. Try clicking "Create Voice" button at the bottom.
    After a short moment, you should get a notification on the top right saying
    "successfully created a job".
  3. Click on "JOBS" tab. Now, you should see a new job that you have just
    created. It usually takes 30mins to 1 hour to run. You can check the status
    of the job by clicking on the job id to see the job status page.
  4. After an hour, you should see "Completed Voice Model Deployment" under
    the job status. This means the successfully built model has been deployed
    to a voice synthesis server. Try putting in "hello" in the text input box
    at the bottom of the job status page and click "Synthesize" button.
    Voice Builder should generate a spectrogram and have a play button for you
    to listen to the voice!


### (Optional) Using Custom Data Exporter
Data Exporter is another additional component you can add to the system.
Normally, Voice Builder can work without Data Exporter. Without it,
Voice Builder would just use the input files as they are.

However, in some cases you want to apply some conversion to your input files
before feeding them into TTS algorithms. For example:

  * You have lexicon file that is in a different format from the one accepted
    by your chosen TTS algorithm.
  * You want to filter out some bad data before using it in your chosen TTS algorithm.

Voice Builder gives you the flexibility to add your own data exporter which you
can use to manipulate data before running the actual TTS algorithm. Your custom
data exporter will get a [Voice Specification](https://github.com/google/voice-builder#voice-specification)
containing file location, chosen TTS algorithm, tuning parameters, etc. You can use these information to
manipulate/convert your data. In the end, your data exporter should put all
necessary files into the designated job folder to trigger the actual TTS algorithm to run.

Firstly, you need to give your data exporter access to GCS buckets.

1. Open /deploy.sh and edit the following variables:

    - DATA_EXPORTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: getting it by creating a new service
      account for your data exporter to access GCS buckets.

2. Run command to give DATA_EXPORTER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT an ACL access to GCS buckets

    ```
    ./deploy.sh acl_for_data_exporter
    ```

    Secondly, you need to set your data exporter's url in config.js so that
    Voice Builder knows where to send Voice Specification information to.

1. Open /config.js and add DATA_EXPORTER_API to the config as follows:

    ```
    DATA_EXPORTER_API: {
      BASE_URL: '<DATA_EXPORTER_URL>',
      API_KEY: '<DATA_EXPORTER_API_KEY>',
    }
    ```
    where BASE_URL is your data exporter url and API_KEY is the api key of your data exporter.

2. Redeploy Voice Builder UI instance so that it now has a new config and knows
  where to send Voice Specification info. to your data exporter

    ```
    ./deploy.sh ui update
    ```

3. Try to create a new job! Voice Builder should now send a request to your DATA_EXPORTER_URL
	with the created job's Voice Specification.


### Voice Builder specification
`VoiceBuildingSpecification` is a JSON definition of the voice specification. This specification is created by the Voice Builder backend when a user triggers a voice building request from the UI.  It can be used by the data exporter (passed to the data exporter via its API) to convert files and by the TTS engine for its training parameters.

##### Example
For example, if you set up your data exporter, when you create a voice
using our predefined Festival engine, Voice Builder will send the request
body similar to below to your data exporter. Your data exporter then have
to pre-process data and put them in `job_folder` location
(which is `gs://your-voice-builder-jobs/1` in this example).
After all necessary files are placed in the folder, the actual voice building
process will begin automatically as expected.

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "voice_name": "my_voice",
  "createdBy": "someone@somemail.com",
  “job_folder”: "gs://your-voice-builder-jobs/1";
  "engine_params": [
